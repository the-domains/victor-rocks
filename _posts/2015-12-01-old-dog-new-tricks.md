Since I was a little boy, I wanted to make video games (much as any kid from my generation, I guess). I had the intuition then that that was a tall order, later confirmed during my University years. The art of videogame-making was something reserved for very smart people, or that devoted their life to that, with big production budgets. Yes, there were successful indies, but for every one of them that made it, a thousand lay on the roadside.

The boom of mobile development meant that there was plenty of opportunities now, you no longer needed to develop for expensive consoles and need a big budget. Still, it felt like too much work to learn all those arcane kits and frameworks just do a lame attempt at a game.

But recently, I've learned of SpriteKit and it looks mighty easy to get started with it. True, I'll still be making lame games, but it doesn't look like too much effort, and besides, the fun will be in the development, not in the playing. So I've started researching more, finding game art, and planning a few possible games (mostly, homages to those games I enjoyed as a kid). I think I have a somewhat novel idea, but there are no pre-made game assets that fit it, so before attempting it, I'll do a couple of games with cheap, commercially available game art, and conventional gameplay, and depending on the results I'll be hiring a designer to made my bespoke game art.
